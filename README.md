# Order-Book-For-Stocks
This is a software engineering project to create an order book for <b>a single stock</b>

An Order Matching Engine, or simply "Matching Engine" is an electronic system that matches <code>Buy</code> and <code>Sell</code> orders for a stock market. A trader can submit several types of orders to a matching engine, which will process the submitted orders and possibly place them into an <b>Order Book</b>, which is an electronic list of buy and sell orders organised by price level.
